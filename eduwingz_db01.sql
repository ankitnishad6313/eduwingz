English itself has basic rules that people need to follow for it to make sense to hearers and readers. Here are some basic English grammar rules that are easy to understand and easy to learn.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Only use capital letters for proper nouns and at the beginning of a sentence.</li>\r\n	<li>For every sentence there should be one noun and one verb. A sentence with more than one noun or verb is confusing to understand.</li>\r\n	<li>When a sentence is complete use appropriate punctuation. There is no need to have dual punctuation when ending a sentence.</li>\r\n	<li>If an apostrophe is needed make sure to use it to show ownership. An apostrophe is also used when words are abbreviated.</li>\r\n	<li>Whenever writing multiple sentences about the same subject or line of thought, use paragraphs to divide long segments of writing.</li>\r\n	<li>Should a line of thought require a list make sure to separate each article by a comma.</li>\r\n	<li>Make sure case and number of the subject and the verb match. It the noun is singular the verb should be singular as well.</li>\r\n	<li>When connecting two lines of thought in a sentence, use a conjunction to make things make better sense.</li>\r\n	<li>If you have two lines of thought that are similar feel free to use a semicolon to combine them.</li>\r\n	<li>Make sure to use the correct tense when writing or speaking English.</li>\r\n	<li>Try not to end a sentence with a preposition.</li>\r\n	<li>A conjunction word should not be used to start a sentence.</li>\r\n	<li>Sentences should be complete thoughts and not fragments.</li>\r\n	<li>Try not to use double negatives. Such as no not never.</li>\r\n	<li>Make sure to use words correctly.</li>\r\n	<li>Avoid repeating lines of thought in sentences.</li>\r\n	<li>Make sure paragraphs are complete, having three to five sentences each.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Rules of English grammar can be hard to understand, but not impossible.

The predicate, on the other hand, is that action or description.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Complete sentences need&nbsp;<strong>both</strong>&nbsp;the subject and the predicate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sentences can be broken down into clauses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example:&nbsp;<em>The boy is going to the school, and he is going to eat there.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a complete sentence composed of two clauses. There are mainly two types of clauses: independent clauses and subordinate clauses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Independent</strong>&nbsp;clauses act as complete sentences, while&nbsp;<strong>subordinate</strong>&nbsp;clauses cannot stand alone and need another clause to complete their meaning. For example:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Independent clause example:&nbsp;<em>The boy went to the school.</em><br />\r\nSubordinate clause example:&nbsp;<em>After the boy went to the school&hellip;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A group of two or more grammatically linked words that&nbsp;<strong>do not</strong>&nbsp;have subject and predicate is a phrase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Example of a complete sentence:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The girl is at home, and tomorrow she is going to the amusement park.</em><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Example of a clause:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The girl is at home</em><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Example of a phrase:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The girl</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can see that &ldquo;the girl&rdquo; is a phrase located in the first clause of the complete sentence above.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phrases act like parts of speech inside clauses. That is, they can act as nouns, adjectives, adverbs and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you find a particularly insightful article while learning and doing your research, or arrive at an interesting idea with a catchy turn of phrase?

(25, 'Strength and Personality', 'Learning from Amitabh Bachchan: 8 Keys to Triumph', NULL, '<p>Learning from Amitabh Bachchan: 8 Keys to Triumph</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A very wise man once said, &quot;Fortune favor&rsquo;s the brave.&quot; Amitabh Bachchan is one of the few Bollywood personalities who&#39;ve personified this statement. Rewind to the years before Bollywood ever gave this man his chance - he slept on a bench in Marine Drive, was rejected by All India Radio, had 12 consecutive flops before his first hit - fast forward to 1997 - his company, ABCL sank, and with it, most of what he had.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amitabh Bachchan&nbsp;is not only an actor but an inspiration to many people across the country. He has seen the best and the worst, and has yet maintained a demeanor that appeals to one and all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the new millennium brought with it fruition of his second round of struggle and since then Amitabh Bachchan has not looked back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amitabh Bachchan overcame two phases of life - the first part was when he struggled and gained his fame, fortune and popularity, and the second part was having everything, losing it all, surviving that struggle, and regaining all that as lost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s have a closer look at Amitabh Bachchan&#39;s life with 8 lessons of success courtesy the Big B.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. Perseverance</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amitabh Bachchan is now an industry in himself. But, before he ever was the Big B, he was an aspiring radio broadcaster who was rejected by All India Radio after his audition. Rejection and struggle notwithstanding, he made his Bollywood debut as a voice narrator in Mrinal Sen&#39;s film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He did what it took to get by, and all that it took to make it. Besides being willing to do lesser jobs before the big break, Amitabh Bachchan was not too proud to find refuge on that one bench in Marine Drive. And, even after he got his break in Bollywood, he tasted failure at the box-office with his first 12 films. However, in spite of this, this phenomenon kept at it, and soon enough struck gold. Perseverance in face of failure, the will to improvise in face of rejection, and the sheer gumption to carry on made Amitabh Bachchan the man he is today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Improvisation is the Way Ahead</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;Amitabh Bachchan had no gold ticket entry into Bollywood. Before ever becoming the star he is, he was willing to do smaller jobs (voiceover artists in a few films). He ensured that he was a part of the industry - no matter how small that part was. He improvised, made use of the skills he could use the most at the time, and turned his voice into a bread earner. His improvisation allowed him to connect with people from the industry and eventually he did get his break in Bollywood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Persistence Always Pays</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even after Amitabh Bachchan got his break in Bollywood, the road to success was elusive. He delivered 12 consecutive flops before his first hit. But, in spite of his films bombing at the box office, this actor kept doing exactly what he loved doing - he acted. Not one to be bothered about naysayers and critics; he focused on the task at hand and was determined to make a name for himself, which he eventually did with absolute panache. Amitabh Bachchan focused on success not his failure to deliver a hit at the box office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. He&#39;s Unpretentious</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to work, he does what it takes to get roles. The turn of the millennium was one of his lowest points - his company went down under in the late &#39;90s and finances were at an all-time low, the few movies that he did after that bombed and he was out of work. He then telephoned the late Yash Chopra and asked him if he had work. The late Mr. Chopra offered Amitabh Bachchan &quot;Mohobbatein&quot;, and since then things picked up. Humbleness and humility always pays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. Dedication</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When he&#39;s on the job, he gets things done, no matter how exhausted he is. In 2006, he recorded 23 scenes in five hours while shooting for &quot;Shootout at Lokhandwala&quot;. He dealt with exhaustion, tiredness, and anything that threatened him completing his scenes. He concentrated on shooting and finishing his task at hand. Only dedication will ever allow you to work through just about anything and everything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6. Passion for his Work</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While shooting for &quot;Aks&quot; in 2001, Amitabh Bachchan performed a stunt from the height of 30 feet. He did this in spite of suffering from a muscle disorder. Passion for what he does, and the fact that he got a second chance to do it, kept Amitabh Bachchan going and he completed the stunt on his own - disorder notwithstanding. With passion comes a sense of commitment and achievement and this man has gone on and lived it over and over again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7. Willingness to Believe the Show Must Go On</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the mid-nineties, after Amitabh Bachchan retired from Bollywood, he launched his own company. However, the company went down and took the actor down with it. He accepted that he failed, but then, he had the guts and gumption to get back into the industry and try and find his bearings once again. This time, it was going back to the drawing board for him, but he did it anyway. He accepted that his business failed miserably, but that didn&#39;t make him a failure. He may have been down for a while, but he had the will to stand up again. Besides getting back to Bollywood, Amitabh Bachchan was one of the first movie stars to make his debut on television with &quot;Kaun Banega Crorepati&quot;, which became the most watched television show in India!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8. Kindness and Compassion go a Long Way</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amitabh Bachchan is worshipped everywhere he goes, and in spite of his iconic status, he ensures that he makes time for his fans and the media. He is known to interact with his fans outside his bungalow in Juhu, Mumbai, and every Sunday. Additionally, his interactions with the media have always been gracious and he makes sure he&#39;s on time for all media interactions and shoots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amitabh Bachchan is an icon, but he is humble in spite of his success. In fact, it&#39;s his humility that makes him even more successful than he already is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And it is extremely important to create your own niche in whichever industry you belong to. Amitabh Bachchan with his deep voice had created an angry young man image, which people still remember. So whatever you do, ensure you do it differently because that helps you make a mark in people&#39;s mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you find a particularly insightful article while learning and doing your research, or arrive at an interesting idea with a catchy turn of phrase?

(26, 'Strength and Personality', 'Elon Musk: Strategies for Success', NULL, '<p>Elon Musk: Strategies for Success</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Elon Musk&#39;s Approach to Leadership and Innovation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. He Inspires His Team</strong> One of the key tenets of transformational leadership is having a vision - and getting others to not only believe in it but be inspired enough to help make it happen. &ldquo;You have to have a very compelling goal for the company,&rdquo; Musk has explained. &ldquo;If you put yourself in the shoes of someone who&rsquo;s talented at a world level, they have to believe that there&rsquo;s potential for a great outcome and believe in the leader of the company, that you&rsquo;re the right guy to work with.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. He Sets Stretch Goals</strong> Whether it&rsquo;s creating brain chips to revolutionize neuroscience or finding a way to colonize Mars, those wildly ambitious, and thus ever-motivating objectives are all a part of Musk&rsquo;s &ldquo;stretch goal&rdquo; strategy. According to the Harvard Business Review, &ldquo;stretch goals involve radical expectations that go beyond current capabilities and performance,&rdquo; and are also marked by extreme novelty. And while the Business Review claims that, in the past, &ldquo;Tesla failed to meet more than 20 of founder Elon Musk&rsquo;s ambitious projections and missed half of them by nearly a year,&rdquo; it also notes that &ldquo;stretch goals are often viewed as truly important sources of individual and organizational motivation and achievement.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. He Challenges the Status Quo</strong> In order to set the bar in every industry he has his hand in, Musk is a firm believer in paving his own way. To achieve things that have never been achieved before, you have to do things that have never been done before. &ldquo;Other advice I would give is to not blindly follow trends,&rdquo; the entrepreneur and engineer has said. &ldquo;Question and challenge the status quo.&rdquo; SpaceX&rsquo;s development of a rocket from &quot;a clean sheet of paper&rdquo; is a prime example. By not including any pre-designed technology and leveraging the best ideas from the rocket industry, SpaceX created a truly innovative vehicle on its own terms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. He Micromanages</strong> Musk is a well-known workaholic, which serves as both a blessing and a curse for his employees. On the one hand, he leads by example&mdash;taking an interest in every single aspect of his projects: &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re co-founder or CEO you have to do all kinds of tasks you might not want to do &hellip; If you don&rsquo;t do your chores, the company won&rsquo;t succeed &hellip;No task is too menial.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. He Hires Smartly</strong> While some former employees maintain &ldquo;There [is] only one decision-maker at Tesla, and it&#39;s Elon Musk,&quot; there&rsquo;s no question that the CEO sees the value in building an excellent team. &ldquo;Talent is extremely important. It&rsquo;s like a sports team, the team that has the best individual player will often win but then there&rsquo;s a multiplier from how those players work together and the strategy they employ.&rdquo; Musk is meticulous about hiring, challenging leaders to hire people better than themselves, making the company better with each hire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6. He Embraces Failure</strong> Effective leaders are not afraid of failure, and Musk has experienced it plenty of times. However, failure does not derail his visions. Instead, he embraces it as a way to prove that his team is really doing something disruptive: &quot;Failure is an option here. If things are not failing you are not innovating,&quot; he&rsquo;s said. For Musk, failure is also necessary to identify problems and improve: &quot;You should take the approach that you&#39;re wrong. Your goal is to be less wrong.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7. He Uses Feedback to Find Solutions</strong> When one uses failure as a lesson, it allows them to tackle problems head-on to find solutions and finally reach their goal. Musk&rsquo;s self-proclaimed &ldquo;single piece of advice&rdquo; on this matter is continuous feedback. &ldquo;I think it&#39;s very important to have a feedback loop, where you&#39;re constantly thinking about what you&#39;ve done and how you could be doing it better. I think that&#39;s the single best piece of advice - constantly think about how you could be doing things better and questioning yourself.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8. He Values Communication</strong> At the core of that aforementioned &ldquo;feedback loop&rdquo; is communication, something Musk urges his employees to do efficiently. In a 2018 internal letter to Tesla employees, Musk urged his team to communicate quickly and directly, ignoring any &ldquo;chain of command.&rdquo; &ldquo;Communication should travel via the shortest path necessary to get the job done, not through the &lsquo;chain of command.&rsquo; Any manager who attempts to enforce chain of command communication will soon find themselves working elsewhere,&rdquo; he wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9. He Hates Meetings</strong> Musk&rsquo;s efficiency model extends to meetings. In his internal Tesla email, he advised getting rid of unnecessary meetings that waste time. &ldquo;Excessive meetings are the blight of big companies and almost always get worse over time. Please get off all large meetings, unless you&rsquo;re certain they are providing value to the whole audience, in which case keep them very short,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;Walk out of a meeting or drop off a call as soon as it is obvious you aren&rsquo;t adding value. It is not rude to leave, it is rude to make someone stay and waste their time.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10. He&rsquo;s Adaptable</strong> One of Musk&rsquo;s biggest strengths&mdash;and faults&mdash;is his ability to adapt and change course at the drop of a hat. The billionaire is known to change his mind based on immediate needs or shift course on projects quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you find a particularly insightful article while learning and doing your research, or arrive at an interesting idea with a catchy turn of phrase?

(27, 'Strength and Personality', 'Elon Reeve Musk', NULL, '<p><strong>&quot;If you get up in the morning and think the future is going to be better, it is a bright day. Otherwise, it&#39;s not.&quot;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, South Africa. His mother is Maye Musk, a model and dietitian, His father is Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property developer. Musk has a younger brother and a younger sister, after his parents divorced in 1980; Musk mostly lived with his father in Pretoria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An entrepreneur and business magnate,&nbsp; He is the founder, CEO, and Chief Engineer at SpaceX; early stage investor, CEO, and Product Architect of Tesla, Inc.; founder of The Boring Company; and co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI. A centibillionaire, Musk is one of the richest people in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elon Musk has been insistent that his biggest strength is his work ethic. He has been known to work long hours to finish what he set out to do since childhood. When first introduced to a computer, a Commodore VIC-20, he stayed up three days and learned the BASIC programming language, a course that was supposed to take six months. His ability to learn things very quickly is also very important to where he is now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He works super hard to achieve what he believes &amp; not giving up till he achieves it.Under his belt, may have gained widespread fame due to his public persona, trigger-happy Twitter finger, and a notorious podcast appearance or two, but the serial entrepreneur and engineer owes his success, first and foremost, to his unique approach to leadership. After all, one can&rsquo;t make billions of dollars without a dedicated team - and Musk has proven that he knows how to build one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elon Musk joins the ranks of Steve Jobs and Jeff Bezos for many when considering the 21st century&rsquo;s most influential CEOs, and like the respective founders of Apple and Amazon, is often cited as having a &ldquo;transformational leadership&rdquo; style. The concept is a part of the Full Range Leadership Model, a theory of three distinct leadership styles that vary in accordance with one&rsquo;s engagement with the people they lead. Unlike those who embrace &ldquo;laissez-faire&rdquo; or &ldquo;transactional&rdquo; styles, a transformational leader is marked by their ability to inspire, motivate, and work closely with their teams to produce extraordinary results. Some managers hire people to complete boring tasks. Transformational leaders surround themselves with people who want to change the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, working with a genius who has grand plans and high expectations isn&rsquo;t always easy. One former employee at Tesla was quoted in Fast Company as saying both, &ldquo;It was incredible,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;d never work there again.&rdquo; Another person who worked under Musk, this time at SpaceX, said of the founder, &ldquo;We were in the presence of brilliance&rdquo; and, &ldquo;It scared me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clearly, &ldquo;complicated&rdquo; comes with the territory of a confident and charismatic innovator. But no matter the conflicting opinions of Musk held by both his employees and the public, no one can deny that he is helping to shape the future, one project at a time. From tackling problems head-on and embracing failure to forgoing meetings whenever possible, <strong>here are the strategies Musk is known to apply on the daily at all of his companies.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>He Inspires his Team</strong></li>\r\n	<li><strong>He Sets Stretch Goals</strong></li>\r\n	<li><strong>He Challenges the Status Quo</strong></li>\r\n	<li><strong>He Micromanages </strong></li>\r\n	<li><strong>He Hires Smartly</strong></li>\r\n	<li><strong>He Embraces Failure</strong></li>\r\n	<li><strong>He Uses Feedback to Find Solutions</strong></li>\r\n	<li><strong>He Values Communication</strong></li>\r\n	<li><strong>He Hates Meetings</strong></li>\r\n	<li><strong>He&rsquo;s Adaptable</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless, his unique approach to management and his fostering of a challenging work environment has clearly led to multibillion-dollar success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Workaholic</strong></li>\r\n	<li><strong>Perseverance</strong></li>\r\n	<li><strong>Visionary storyteller</strong></li>\r\n	<li><strong>Embrace Failure</strong></li>\r\n	<li><strong>Encourage Innovation</strong></li>\r\n	<li><strong>Creative</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you find a particularly insightful article while learning and doing your research, or arrive at an interesting idea with a catchy turn of phrase?

He co-founded Instagram, the world&#39;s largest photo sharing website, along with <strong>Mike Krieger</strong> in 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meeting at a cafe turned into a billion dollar business and a partnership that&rsquo;s lasted a decade. A key to their relationship, understanding each other&rsquo;s strengths and how those translated into individual roles at a company: CEO and CTO, respectively. But the title that came first and foremost, for both of them, was co-founder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kevin Systrom attended <strong>Stanford University</strong> and graduated in 2006 with a bachelor&#39;s degree in management science and engineering, worked on Google&#39;s Gmail and corporate development, spent his weekends building an app that allowed location-aware photo and note-sharing, dubbing it Burbn. That&#39;s how&nbsp;<strong>Systrom met Mike Krieger</strong>, Instagram&#39;s co-founder:&nbsp;<strong>Krieger</strong>&nbsp;was an enthusiastic early Burbn user.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>At Stanford University</strong> he was a member of the <strong>Sigma Nu fraternity</strong> and turned down a recruitment offer from <strong>Mark Zuckerberg</strong> and instead spent the winter term of his third year in Florence, where he studied photography.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right before his senior year at Stanford, Systrom interned at a podcasting company called <strong>Odeo</strong>. Odeo was founded by Evan Williams, who went on to create Twitter. <strong>Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey</strong> was also working at Odeo at the time, and he and Systrom became good friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some might call them lucky. They launched a photo app, got 100,000 users in their first week, and sold it for $1 billion less than two years later. In April 2012, Instagram, along with 13 employees, was <strong>sold to Facebook</strong> for US$1 billion in cash and stock. He worked at twitter and google before finding Instagram.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instagram&rsquo;s success isn&rsquo;t 100% attributable to luck. It solved real problems; Systrom says that entrepreneurs &ldquo;should not be afraid to have simple solutions to simple problems.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instagram Was First Called &#39;Burbn&#39;. People weren&#39;t using Burbn&#39;s check-in features at all. What they were using, though, were the app&#39;s photo-sharing features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Instagram, they focused on solving three problems and their solutions were:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Making photos beautiful</li>\r\n	<li>Sharing on multiple social networks</li>\r\n	<li>Uploading photos quickly</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Over time what you do is you simply take in data about what your users are doing and you focus on the stuff that people love the most. The second we focused on the photos with the filters, it became a phenomenon.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Krieger and Systrom have shared some of what they learned along the way and what they recommend for other entrepreneurs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Let&rsquo;s get into some entrepreneurial Lessons from Instagram Co-Founder Kevin Systrom in his words</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t be Afraid to Pivot</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to not only listen to what users say, but watch their behavior: &ldquo;Behavior speaks much louder than words.&rdquo; and &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about feedback based on behavior.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The lesson I&rsquo;ve learned is that you need to make sure to always cut what doesn&rsquo;t work, cut the stuff that isn&rsquo;t popular, and focus on continually improving your product and your focus&hellip;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>You Don&rsquo;t Need a Big Team in Order to do Great Things</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re building a team, I don&rsquo;t think it should be about filling head count. You shouldn&rsquo;t say &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to go out there and try to be a 50 person company or something.&rsquo; What we&rsquo;ve done so far I think has worked very well, which is we find the best people in the world. The best designers, the best engineers, and that&rsquo;s who we bring on&hellip;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;For us it&rsquo;s really about picking the exact positions on the field that we want to fill and finding the best people to fill those.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hire Smart and Passionate People</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I look for passion. I think smart people are passionate people. When you ask them what they&rsquo;re really good at and what they&rsquo;re really passionate about, usually they can explain it in a way that makes you get inspired about something, whether that&rsquo;s about cocktail making, cooking or coding. Smart people have passions in life and that&rsquo;s really what I look for&hellip;.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>You&rsquo;re Not Just Starting a Product, You&rsquo;re Starting an Organization</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I think when people decide on whether or not they&rsquo;re going to go into entrepreneurship, you need to remember that building a product is great, but there is a lot of legwork involved in getting a team off the ground, I think specifically in recruiting a team. Team building is one of the most important things when you get off the ground. It&rsquo;s not just about having a great idea. It&rsquo;s finding the people to bring in to make that idea happen and supporting them by shielding them from the press and the checking accounts that you have to set up, etc. Especially raising capital&hellip;.at the same time, it&rsquo;s supremely important to know that you have to be good at building a product and that you&rsquo;re going to be willing to do the legwork to do the rest. &ldquo;Be Able to Explain What You Do in 30 Seconds or Less</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do too much, and cut away everything that doesn&rsquo;t matter to the success of your product. Doing too much can create drag and hinder your ability to get things done.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>You&rsquo;ll Start Losing When You Think You&rsquo;ve Won</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The second anyone starts thinking &lsquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ve won,&rsquo; you just start acting differently; and I just think that&rsquo;s one of the things in Silicon Valley that companies need to work actively against.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Avoid Private Beta</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Stay away from this private beta stuff.

After many projects together, they licensed <strong>Google.com in 1997.</strong> One year later, they founded <strong>&ldquo;Google&rdquo;,</strong> as a privately held company, where Page took the position of the <strong>CEO</strong> and Brin as its <strong>president</strong>. In 2001, Page and Brin decided to appoint Eric Schmidt as CEO of &ldquo;Google&rdquo;, while Page took the position of president for products, and Sergey Brin as president for technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All three, Larry Page, Sergey Brin and Eric Schmidt have a <strong>unique innovation style</strong> of leading and motivating as well as their vision for information sharing is unique too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s shed some light on page&rsquo;s rules for management:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Don&#39;t delegate,</strong> do everything you can yourself to make things go faster.</li>\r\n	<li>Don&#39;t get in the way if you&#39;re not adding value.

This style ensures that employees at the company are always motivated, hence increasing their productivity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being <strong>task oriented</strong> and more directives is another style he used. Consequently, he demands his management staff to always keep him up-to-date on current projects in order to accomplish the company&rsquo;s motto of quick and concise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Perseverance</strong> is the other leadership style of Google chief executive officer Larry Page. Despite the challenges or obstacles he faces, he always strives to advance technology in all sectors of life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Weakness of Larry Page is his inability to effectively communicate his plans and decisions to external entities and investors; AND obsession with transformational motivation.

(30, 'Strength and Personality', 'Mark Elliot Zuckerberg', NULL, '<p><strong>&ldquo;Find that thing you are super passionate about.&rdquo;&nbsp; AND</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Simply put: we don&rsquo;t build services to make money; we make money to build better services.&rdquo; &ndash; Mark Zuckerberg</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mark Elliot Zuckerberg</strong> (born May 14, 1984, White Plains, New York U.S.) is an American media magnate, internet entrepreneur, and philanthropist. He is a co-founder and CEO of the social-networking website <strong>Facebook, </strong>which has given us the privilege to be with our friend&rsquo;s n families <strong>27/7</strong> and share each moment with them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After attending Phillips Exeter Academy, Zuckerberg enrolled at <strong>Harvard University</strong> in 2002 where he launched the Facebook from his dormitory room on February 4, 2004, with college roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes. Originally launched to select college campuses, the site expanded rapidly and eventually beyond colleges, reaching one billion users by 2012. Zuckerberg took the company public in May 2012 with majority shares. In 2007, at age 23, he became the world&#39;s youngest self-made billionaire. He is the only person under 40 years old, in <strong>Forbes&#39;</strong> list of the <strong>20 richest people. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mark Zuckerberg illustrates the transformational leadership style in action. He is described as encouraging and aggressive. A person who always demands <strong>constant innovation</strong> and growth, he loves debates and challenges. He uses all 3 styles of leadership <strong>(autocratic, democratic, and laissez-faire).</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s look at some of his <strong>qualities/Strengths</strong> as he is one of those people whose public experience teaches us about what it really means to achieve success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Assertiveness</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>He noted in a Wired Magazine interview, &ldquo;Sometimes we are going to do stuff that&rsquo;s controversial, and we&rsquo;re going to make mistakes. We have to be willing to take risks.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s this attitude that proves how a product, service, company and brand can make strides in completely changing an industry. Success doesn&rsquo;t come from worrying about how something will work; instead, you just have to jump in and do it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Critical thinking</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once he said, &ldquo;I got my first computer in the 6th grade or so. As soon as I got it, I was interested in finding out how it worked and how the programs worked and then figuring out how to write programs at just deeper and deeper levels within the system.&rdquo; I could see that success only comes from taking the time to think more critically rather than just accepting the first idea that comes to mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Problem-solving </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>He noted in a biography about him, &ldquo;The question I ask myself like almost every day is, &#39;Am I doing the most important thing I could be doing?&#39; Unless I feel like I&#39;m working on the most important problem that I can help with, then I&#39;m not going to feel good about how I&#39;m spending my time.&rdquo; I knew that, at the heart of every business I considered creating, there had to be a relevant problem that needed solving to help a consumer or a business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Equanimity</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a fancy way of saying that Zuckerberg doesn&rsquo;t lose his cool when he&#39;s under pressure or in a stressful situation. Instead, he calmly approaches even the most difficult situations because anger doesn&rsquo;t breed success -- it only serves to alienate or give the impression that someone feels they don&rsquo;t have control over a situation. Developing this equanimity has helped improve my relationships with employees and colleagues while providing a way to think more clearly about the critical problem or pressures in front of me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mindfulness</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zuckerberg doesn&rsquo;t let his critics get to him. I learned that the ability to ignore the noise around me has helped me to use the energy I would have wasted on worrying about what others thought of me. I use it to fuel creativity, innovation and actions that have furthered my business success. Taking a mindfulness approach to what you want to accomplish -- and blocking out the rest -- is critical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Developing the right company culture</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facebook isn&rsquo;t like an ordinary workplace. It doesn&rsquo;t maintain any strict flat hierarchy or workplace rules. Here employees with creativity, innovation, and out-of-the-box get valued and rewarded. Any employee can just relax anywhere in the office and do his work. The whole Facebook office&rsquo;s design is the most unique one than any other big company in the world. And all these ideas mainly came from Zuckerberg, who wanted to build a workplace environment and culture where people won&rsquo;t feel pressured and enjoy working.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being a person who brought a change in the world of social networking, Mark Zuckerberg is an <strong>INTJ (Introversion, Intuition, Thinking and Judgment)</strong> personality type entrepreneur like Elon Musk. He is an introvert by nature and unlike other CEOs; he is seen communicating very less during presentations to investors. Being a typical INTJ he has a vision and he works on the path to achieve his vision and goal. He has a habit of keeping a schedule, maintaining structure and controlling the necessary resources to achieve what he desires. Mark Zuckerberg even keeps a leather notebook which he calls <strong>&ldquo;The Book of Change&rdquo;</strong> which contains all the ideas for the future direction of Facebook. He is least bothered about his appearance and doesn&rsquo;t care about getting in tune with the latest fashion which makes him a proper INTJ type person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>He is absolutely a motivation for the coming generation of entrepreneurs.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strengths</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Assertiveness</li>\r\n	<li>Innovative-vision</li>\r\n	<li>Equanimity</li>\r\n	<li>Problem-solving</li>\r\n	<li>Effective communication</li>\r\n	<li>Mindfulness</li>\r\n	<li>Multi-tasking</li>\r\n	<li>Risk taking/Accepting challenges</li>\r\n	<li>Competitive</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you find a particularly insightful article while learning and doing your research, or arrive at an interesting idea with a catchy turn of phrase?

This shaped his interest in the field as he grew up. At age 13, he met one the most important persons in his life: 18-year-old Stephen Wozniak, who was equally curious about electronics and computers and, like Steve, an <strong>incorrigible</strong> prankster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Steve Jobs and Stephen Wozniak co-founded apple in <strong>1997</strong>. They first introduced the <strong>Apple I</strong> and later the <strong>Apple II</strong>. Apple went public in 1980 with Jobs as the blazing visionary and Wozniak, the shy genius executing his vision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Steve Jobs was a <strong>workaholic</strong> and had the reputation of being a tyrant. His <strong>charismatic attitude, passionate demeanor, risk-taking temperament, and non-traditional conducts</strong> define his personality. A <strong>creative entrepreneur</strong> whose <strong>passion for perfection</strong> and<strong> ferocious</strong> drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lifetime of Apple founder Steve Jobs is inspiring for everybody; the way he has overcome all the struggles in his life and touched new dimensions of success in his life is truly praise-worthy. There was a time in Jobs&#39; life when he had to satisfy his hunger by eating food found in a temple and sleeping in the land of friend&#39;s house. Let&#39;s realize the inspirational lifetime of Steve Jobs by his principles for success:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Do your passion.</strong></li>\r\n	<li><strong>Simplify everything.</strong></li>\r\n	<li><strong>Unleash your creativity.</strong></li>\r\n	<li><strong>Create an insanely great customer experience.</strong></li>\r\n	<li><strong>Become the storyteller-in-chief.</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Executive John Scully was added in 1983 by Jobs himself and in 1985, Apple&#39;s board ousted the combative Jobs in favor of Scully.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Steve Jobs</strong>&#39; introduces his life again as he was fired from his own company Apple, but despite all this; he never gave up and kept moving forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His greatest&nbsp;<strong>strength</strong>&nbsp;was <strong>bringing together the ideas and intellect</strong> of truly great, talented people. Away from Apple, Jobs invested in and developed animation producer, <strong>PIXAR</strong> and then founded <strong>NeXT</strong> to create high-end computers; NeXT eventually led him to Apple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jobs returned to Apple in the late 1990s and spent the later years, revamping the company, introducing the iPod, iPhone and iPad, transforming technology and communication in the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every person has <strong>peculiar traits</strong> that make him who he is or can be. It is a well-known proverb that <strong>it&rsquo;s not the person who makes habits but habits make a person</strong>. So,&nbsp;even this innovative reformer of technology too has certain habits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s shed light on <strong>some of his </strong>Personality Traits which have contributed successfully to his legendary personality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Innovative</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>He strongly upheld his belief in &ldquo;<a href=\"http://amzn.to/2kKNyV3\" target=\"_blank\">Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish</a>&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What he wanted to say by the term &ldquo;stay hungry&rdquo; was that one should never be satisfied with what one has at the present moment because there is always a chance to make things better. The term &ldquo;stay foolish&rdquo; was used by him to tell everyone around that if you always feel that you are foolish enough and there is still a lot to learn in life, you will always be better than a day before. Moreover, he believed that there is no such thing as &ldquo;impossible&rdquo;, so just because someone hasn&rsquo;t ever tried something new doesn&rsquo;t mean that even you cannot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So people don&rsquo;t consider yourself erudite as the moment you create an illusion of knowing everything, your growth stops right away. Rather you must remain down to earth and feel as if you still need to learn a lot. This foolish thought of not knowing much will always help you delve into things, so your growth will be unstoppable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Innovation is indeed the key to success and APPLE testifies it clearly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Failure couldn&rsquo;t stop Steve Jobs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Steve Jobs believed that though taking medicine is awful but if the patient requires it, it has to be given.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Apple grew up as a company, Steve Jobs hired John Sculley and at the board meeting, he was kicked out of the company. But that&rsquo;s not where Steve Jobs stopped. Rather it helped him more to grow. The heaviness of being successful was supplanted with the lightness of being a beginner. After being kicked out, he started two companies,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT\" target=\"_blank\">NEXT</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pixar.com/our-story-1#our-story\" target=\"_blank\">PIXAR</a>. Not only this, he even found his spouse in this period. Apple purchased NEXT stock resulting in Steve Jobs&rsquo; return to Apple. The amalgam of NEXT hardware with Apple resulted in operating systems like IOS used for I Phones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strong believer of Perfection</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was a strong believer of things with perfection and if things didn&rsquo;t turn up according to his expectations, he would do anything to make things meet his level of expectations which demand perfection from all its ends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Believed in Secrecy</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Restrictions or walls prevailed in Apple Inc as Steve Jobs was a believer of secrecy.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the company, the programmers were not allowed to see the products. The designers were broken into small groups to work on different areas. People were fired without any prior notice on sharing the company&rsquo;s secrets with anyone outside the company. The users were not allowed into the design studios.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Narcissist</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narcissism is what defines Steve Jobs&rsquo; personality the most as&nbsp;he is not at all known for his love for others but love for his own self and company. He hardly cared for others. He often used to park his car reserved for the handicapped. California has a rule that a car owner should have a plate on a new car within six months, and Steve Jobs never followed this rule as he changed his cars after every 6 months. He hardly listened to what others used to say and not every time he was right in his beliefs. There was a&nbsp;time in his life where he didn&rsquo;t take bath for a couple of days and he thought that if he goes on a specific diet, i.e. diet of&nbsp;apples or carrots or any other specific fruit or vegetable, he would not stink. But it was only after a couple of days when his colleagues made him smell himself that he took bath.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Zen Follower</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since his childhood, he had given importance to the&nbsp;peace of mind. After working with technology for a long period of time, he traveled to India for 7 months in quest of spiritual enlightenment. He often inclined himself towards meditation. He even liked walking barefoot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Strong and Clear Vision throughout his Life</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the early age of his life, he knew that he wanted to do something big in life.

(66, 'Voice and Accent', 'Understanding Phonics: A Comprehensive Guide', NULL, '<h2>Understanding Phonics: A Comprehensive Guide</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Phonics is a method of teaching reading and writing by developing learners&#39; ability to hear, identify, and manipulate sounds (phonemes) in words. It is fundamental to mastering literacy skills, especially for young learners. Here&rsquo;s an in-depth look at phonics and its importance:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. <strong>What is Phonics?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phonics is a teaching technique that links the sounds (phonemes) of spoken language with the letters or groups of letters (graphemes) that represent those sounds in written language. It helps learners decode words by sounding them out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. <strong>Key Components of Phonics</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Phonemes</strong>: The smallest units of sound in a language. For example, the word &quot;cat&quot; has three phonemes: /k/, /&aelig;/, and /t/.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Graphemes</strong>: The letters or groups of letters that represent phonemes. For example, the phoneme /f/ can be represented by the grapheme &quot;ph&quot; in &quot;phone.&quot;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Blending</strong>: Combining individual phonemes to form words. For example, blending /c/, /a/, and /t/ forms &quot;cat.&quot;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Segmenting</strong>: Breaking down words into their individual phonemes. For example, segmenting &quot;dog&quot; into /d/, /É’/, and /g/.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Digraphs</strong>: Two letters that make one sound, such as &quot;sh&quot; in &quot;ship&quot; or &quot;ch&quot; in &quot;chair.&quot;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Trigraphs</strong>: Three letters that make one sound, such as &quot;igh&quot; in &quot;night.&quot;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>3. <strong>Phonics Instruction Methods</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Synthetic Phonics</strong>: Teaching children to read and write by blending the sounds of letters to form words. Each phoneme is taught in isolation before blending them to form words.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Analytic Phonics</strong>: Teaching children to analyze whole words and break them down into their phonetic components. This approach often focuses on word families and patterns.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Embedded Phonics</strong>: Integrating phonics instruction within the context of reading and writing activities. Phonics skills are taught as needed while reading and writing text.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>4. <strong>Benefits of Phonics</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Improves Decoding Skills</strong>: Helps children understand how letters correspond to sounds, enabling them to decode new words.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Enhances Reading Fluency</strong>: By recognizing letter-sound relationships, children can read more quickly and smoothly.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Builds Spelling Skills</strong>: Phonics helps children spell words accurately by understanding sound-letter correspondences.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Supports Reading Comprehension</strong>: Fluent reading allows children to focus on understanding the meaning of the text rather than struggling with word recognition.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>5. <strong>Phonics Activities and Games</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Sound Matching</strong>: Matching pictures or objects with the corresponding initial sound.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Word Families</strong>: Exploring groups of words that share common phonetic patterns, such as &quot;cat,&quot; &quot;bat,&quot; and &quot;hat.&quot;</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Phonics Bingo</strong>: Playing bingo games with letter sounds, digraphs, or word families.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Flashcards</strong>: Using flashcards with letters, sounds, and words to reinforce learning.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Interactive Apps</strong>: Utilizing educational apps and online games that focus on phonics skills.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>6. <strong>Tips for Teaching Phonics</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Consistency</strong>: Be consistent in the approach and regularly practice phonics skills.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Engagement</strong>: Use fun and interactive activities to keep learners engaged.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Repetition</strong>: Repeated practice helps reinforce phonics skills and improves retention.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Positive Reinforcement</strong>: Encourage and praise children&rsquo;s efforts to build confidence.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Customization</strong>: Tailor phonics instruction to meet the individual needs of learners.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Phonics is a powerful tool in teaching reading and writing, providing a strong foundation for literacy development. By understanding the sounds of language and how they relate to written text, learners can become proficient readers and writers. With regular practice and engaging activities, phonics can make the journey of learning to read and write both effective and enjoyable. ðŸ“–ðŸŒŸ</p>\r\n', '2024-12-06 07:21:28'),

Our company is built for trainers, by trainers, so we thought we would share some of our tips with you, to help you create an engaging, unforgettable experience for your participants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; <strong>Make it customized. </strong>By tailoring each course to your participants, you will find that your results will increase a thousand-fold. o Use examples, case studies, and stories that are relevant to the group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>o Identify whether your participants are strangers or whether they work together. Tailor your approach appropriately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>o Different people learn in different ways, so use different types of activities to balance it all out. (For example, some people learn by reading, while others learn by talking about it, while still others need a hands-on approach. For more information, we suggest Experiential Learning by David Kolb.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; <strong>Make it fun and interactive. </strong>Most people do not enjoy sitting and listening to someone else talk for hours at a time. Make use of the tips in this book and your own experience to keep your participants engaged. Mix up the activities to include individual work, small group work, large group discussions, and mini-lectures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; <strong>Make it relevant. </strong>Participants are much more receptive to learning if they understand why they are learning it and how they can apply it in their daily lives. Most importantly, they want to know how it will benefit them and make their lives easier. Take every opportunity to tie what you are teaching back to real life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; <strong>Keep an open mind. </strong>Many trainers find that they learn something each time they teach a workshop. If you go into a training session with that attitude, you will find that there can be an amazing two-way flow of information between the trainer and trainees. Enjoy it, learn from it, and make the most of it in your workshops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And now, time for the training!</p>\r\n', '2024-12-06 09:30:35'),
